                The Cyberrona is a small, spacial bacteria belonging to the genus Corona.
                It is one of the only bacterias capable of enduring space's harsh environment.
                Whilst other bacterias have been discovered living in space, this is the most dynamic, complex organism
                found to date. It is carnivorous and presents predatory behaviors, enlarging in size
                after consuming other organisms. It appears to interact with electric currrents which give it rings
                which orbit
                its main body, as well as making it blink different colors and shake erratically when it does not move.
                It is still unknown whether the electricity is a benefit for the creature but it certainly does not
                diminish its normal
                capabilities.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span>
                Its recent discovery means that human interaction is not advised as we do not know the impact of the
                interaction
                would be. However, it does not appear to present aggressive behaviors towards the scientists examining
                it. It is also
                prohibited by government regulations to touch or entrap the creature as its effects on Earth could be
                detrimental to both
                national security and global health alike.
